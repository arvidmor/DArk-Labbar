Test code 1:
Load what is at memory 0 to register $t1
Store what is in register $t2 to memory 0

Works. No dependencies



Test code 2:
Load what is at instruction 0 to register $t1
Store what is in register $t1 to memory 3

Doesn't work because of dependencies. Operation 2 will try to read the value produced
from operation 1 to soon. Need 3 NOP's. Of double pumped, would have needed 2 NOP's.

Test code 3:
Load what is at instruction 0 to register $t1
Load what is at instruction 1 to register $t2
Add t1 and t2, store in t3
Add t3 and t1, store in t3
Store t3 to instruction 4

Doesn't work because of dependencies. Needs total of 9 NOP's.
